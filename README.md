The Sales Prediction project aims to forecast future sales based on historical sales data using machine learning techniques. This project helps businesses understand sales trends, customer behavior, and the impact of different factors on overall revenue.
The dataset includes features such as:
dvertising spend (TV, Radio, Newspaper / Marketing cost)
Product or store information

Past sales records

The project starts with data cleaning and preprocessing, followed by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, trends, and correlations between sales and influencing factors. Data visualization techniques are used to gain clear insights into sales performance.

Various regression models such as Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and other machine learning models are trained to predict sales accurately. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like R² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

This project demonstrates practical knowledge of regression analysis, data visualization, feature selection, and predictive modeling, which are essential skills in data science and business analytics.
